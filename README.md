##Junior Web Developer


For three months I have been intensively studying full stack web development at General Assembly. I got here in a roundabout sort of way. At university I studied art and loved learning about building things. However I knew I never wanted to do art as a career. I started learning web development straight out of art school, whilst working as a chef. I knew for sure after several months that this is what I wanted to do and wanted the acceleration that WDI offered.

Every morning at GA we had a Scrum and the people there quickly became like family to me.  I have learnt so much and there is so much I want to keep learning as a Web Developer. I’m really keen on the MEAN stack, front end and Ruby on Rails but I’m interested in doing something of everything. I am looking for a Junior role and I am excited about learning new languages and technologies.

Over the last three months I have learnt a lot about myself, I’m happy that I’m somewhere I want to be in my life. And want to keep improving my skills and growing my coding knowledge as part of a wider tech community.

###Project 1-JavaScript point and click Game-Space Invasion

For my first project at GA, I built a space invader style game, getting to grips with using the fundamentals of jQuery for DOM manipulation, pushing myself to complete an MVP that was all about the front end.
Event Handling
Scope
DOM manipulation
Learning the power of JavaScript and jQuery
Sound Manager library

###Project 2- Ruby on Rails-RedesignTheCity
http://github.com/bam-sethi/public_architecture_consultancy

I built my second project in Ruby on Rails and the idea was to let users talk about the city they live in through its buildings.  The aim is to give people an online voice in the development of their city.  The app allows users to write about and upload suggestions for building uses/designs and to vote on each other’s suggestions for the city through a ‘Like’ button function. 
I learnt …
RESTful Routes
Active Record- creating and Seeding a Relational Database
Understanding the MVC and the separation of concerns
Rails Gems- Carrier Wave, Debugging Gems …
Amazon AWS  
Materialize CSS 
I really enjoyed this Project, Rails gives you the opportunity to build something substantial with lots of different features. I found it fun and challenging moving between Ruby logic and JavaScript logic. I got see how useful Ruby on Rails can be for doing quick prototyping to longer term projects.

###Project 3-Node.JS and Express-RADLondon
https://github.com/bam-sethi/RAD_London 

RadLondon was my first group project. We built an App to teach people about the radical/political history of East London. Using the Google Maps API, we created custom interactive maps of the area with pins that contained major historical events.
 Used and learnt:
Node.js with MongoDB and Mongoose
Express Framework
Google Maps API
Node Modules and Middleware
Multiple AJAX requests
Passport authentication with twitter authentication
jQuery and JavaScript 
Client/Server Requests
Working as a group meant we could push ourselves in terms of scope, I loved doing pair programming, and found having to explain as you code a pretty invaluable experience. It also meant we learnt about working on a big Git repository, on different branches.

###Project 4-Node.JS and Angular-TwitterDoom
http://github.com/bam-sethi/project-4-twitter-appy

My final project is an emotional visualisation chart for London.  I used the Twitter API to live stream tweets and passed them through a Sentiment Analysis API that I could then manipulate on the client side using AngularJS.  My main aim in this project was to challenge myself by working with RealTime data and Data Visualisation. 
Technologies I used and learnt:
Node.js
Socket.io
Twitter Streaming API
Sentiment API
AngularJS
Chart.JS
I really enjoy writing front and backend JavaScript. Using multiple API’s concurrently meant I got to learn about handling Cross Origin Requests, while also experimenting with AngularJS and it’s modules and dependencies.

##PREVIOUS WORK


Head Chef @ The Shack Kitchen (The Shacklewell Arms) 2015

While I was teaching myself coding before I joined GA I had a job as a Chef and got promoted to Kitchen Manager. I was in charge of everything from health and safety of staff, to ordering stock and ensuring people had an excellent meal on their plate every night. I really loved working in a kitchen and cooking for people.


Coms and Admin @ 38Degrees 2014-2015

Working at 38Degrees I did a bit of everything, I was part of the front line staff, talking to people on the phone about current campaigns and doing administrative tasks. I really enjoyed talking to people about campaigns. While I was there I got to chat to their development team and have a look at their tech and processes.


Detainee Support Group with SDS in 2010-2012 (Voluntary)

I would go to Yarlswood Detention Center and support women who were detained because of their migration status. We would support them practically with their legal papers and I corresponded with immigration lawyers on their behalf.


Set Designer and Production Assistant @ PunkDrunk Theatre Company 2008-2009
I worked as an Assistant Set Designer, designing rooms and researching historically convincing details to create an immersive theatre experience. The two main productions I worked on were “It Felt Like a Kiss” and “The Duchess of Malfi”.

##EDUCATION

B.A First Class Honors @ Slade School of Fine Art (UCL) 2009-2015

I studied and experimented with a variety of different mediums and technologies. I started off as a painter but got the opportunity to study bronze casting, screen printing, sculpture, film editing alongside digital and dark room photography. It was very self led and mostly studio based. At Slade I really started growing and getting interested in politics, particularly the issues of technologies and how it and society interact. 


Foundation Diploma @ Byam Shaw 2008-2009

At Byam Shaw (Central Saint Martins) I studied painting and media for which i received a Distinction, it was an amazing year long course that set me up for my degree.

#ABOUT ME

I’m interested in technology giving people a voice in the development of their society, and how people can use technology to improve their lives. I really enjoy Hackathons and Meetups; the open source, teach each-other philosophy of dev communities is, I think, its greatest strength, and one of the main reasons why I am where I am today. When I’m not coding I love doing boxing at my local boxing club, chatting politics and cooking.
